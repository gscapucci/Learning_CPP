# Object Oriented Programming in C++
## Classes
Classes are like blueprint that is used to create objects.
Classes have:
- Attributes
    - Private Attributes by default
- Constructor
    - Special method for Object
    - Same name is Class
    - No return Type
    - Mostly public
## Access Modifiers
- Private
    - Cannot Acess beyond classes or cannot access the attibs from objects.
- Protected
- Public
    - Can Acess beyond classes or can access the attibs from objects.
## Nesting of Methods and Private Methods
- We can use Private Methods by Nesting into Public Method
    - As shown in [1's_complement_with_Object.cpp](https://github.com/sushantbramhacharya/Learning_CPP/blob/main/Object_Orientation/1's_complement_with_Object.cpp)
- Nesting is the process where we use method inside of methods.
- Done in [1's_complement_with_Object.cpp](https://github.com/sushantbramhacharya/Learning_CPP/blob/main/Object_Orientation/1's_complement_with_Object.cpp)
## Encapsulation
- No directly modifying data
- specific public methods are uses as:
    - Getters
    - Setters
